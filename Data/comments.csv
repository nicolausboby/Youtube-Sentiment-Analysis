CD8s0qwjpoQ,Hacking Livestream #64: async/await in Python 3,"You weren’t able to figure it out today, but I enjoyed the journey a lot. Keep up the great work."
CD8s0qwjpoQ,Hacking Livestream #64: async/await in Python 3,Start @ 3:35
CD8s0qwjpoQ,Hacking Livestream #64: async/await in Python 3,"AFAIK await  is still just like yield from and coroutines are just like generators, they just made yield from only compatible with generators and await - with coroutines.
Seconding David Beazley recommendation, his presentations are amazing. He shows how to run a coroutine at https://youtu.be/E-1Y4kSsAFc?t=774 Other presentations (some are about async) are at dabeaz.com/talks.html
Also, if you want to read sources of an async library, I'd recommend David's Curio or more production-ready and less experimental Trio. Asyncio creates too many abstractions and entities to be easily comprehended."
DYhAoM1Kny0,Asynchronous input with Python and Asyncio,good job Hoff i like the Asyncio video
DYhAoM1Kny0,Asynchronous input with Python and Asyncio,"I came here after watching a video on Hall PC, the Windows NT and OS/2 Shoutout from 1993 and they described this as being a feature in Windows 3.11 NT and OS/2 that year. Before they had this you usually had to wait until after an hour glass ended before you could use your other application you had opened.  I didn't think it actually had other applications other than in system programming. Very interesting stuff, btw I really don't feel confident in writing my own operating system."
DYhAoM1Kny0,Asynchronous input with Python and Asyncio,"Is there a previous video, or are you just referencing offscreen stuff at the beginning?"

L10FeA84EgE,"Live Coding: Advanced Python Discord Bots (Music, Database, RPG)","Does anyone know how to list the servers on which the bot is connected? I need to perform a different procedure for each server connected, but I found the documentation very confusing."
L10FeA84EgE,"Live Coding: Advanced Python Discord Bots (Music, Database, RPG)",using mongodb in this one was hella easier ;) but nice one mate
L10FeA84EgE,"Live Coding: Advanced Python Discord Bots (Music, Database, RPG)",this is terrible and why do you use a old version of the libary that is unsupported and depricated
L10FeA84EgE,"Live Coding: Advanced Python Discord Bots (Music, Database, RPG)",are you using discord.py rewrite
L10FeA84EgE,"Live Coding: Advanced Python Discord Bots (Music, Database, RPG)","Hey, dude can U make a vid explains how to shard discord.py please"
L10FeA84EgE,"Live Coding: Advanced Python Discord Bots (Music, Database, RPG)","Gotta do more of this stuff man. It's showing me important things like connecting to a SQL server in my code. Keep 'em coming. I'm a Sys Admin right now trying to learn some code to maybe start up a side-gig for making small apps and bots for servers, so videos like this that I can learn from are essential."
L10FeA84EgE,"Live Coding: Advanced Python Discord Bots (Music, Database, RPG)",good video
L10FeA84EgE,"Live Coding: Advanced Python Discord Bots (Music, Database, RPG)",you have a lot of interesting projects. Keep the vids coming mate!
L10FeA84EgE,"Live Coding: Advanced Python Discord Bots (Music, Database, RPG)",i dont understand anything<3
L10FeA84EgE,"Live Coding: Advanced Python Discord Bots (Music, Database, RPG)",What do you use for that dog?
L10FeA84EgE,"Live Coding: Advanced Python Discord Bots (Music, Database, RPG)",what do you host your code on to keep it running
L10FeA84EgE,"Live Coding: Advanced Python Discord Bots (Music, Database, RPG)",thanks this motivates me to finish my discord bot

2ukHDGLr9SI,Getting started with event loops: the magic of select,can you share source codes ?
2ukHDGLr9SI,Getting started with event loops: the magic of select,what about server.py ?
2ukHDGLr9SI,Getting started with event loops: the magic of select,Thank you so much for the video! What terminal are you using? It looks so easy to change the size of the window
2ukHDGLr9SI,Getting started with event loops: the magic of select,need socket.setblocking(False) ?
2ukHDGLr9SI,Getting started with event loops: the magic of select,"Thank you for the tutorial. I am having some difficulty in getting the code to work.

Issue:
 File ""ChatClient.py"", line 32, in chat_client
    ready_to_read,_,_ = select.select(socket_list,[],[],0)
OSError: [WinError 10038] An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket

Code:
socket_list = [sys.stdin, s]
ready_to_read,_,_ = select.select(socket_list,[],[],0)

The code does not seem to appreciate ""sys.stdin"" being in the list. What might I be doing wrong based on this snippet? I am using Python 3.6.5."
2ukHDGLr9SI,Getting started with event loops: the magic of select,Would love to know more about this. Please explain more thoroughly.. Thanks!!
2ukHDGLr9SI,Getting started with event loops: the magic of select,"are you just trying to show us how you program? cause this doesn't feel like a lesson. maybe I'm wrong and it isn't one, but if it is, please do explain what you're doing."
2ukHDGLr9SI,Getting started with event loops: the magic of select,this doesn't work on Mac OS
